Hi, my name is Marina. Iâ€™m a computer science graduate with a masterâ€™s degree and previous experience as a customer support specialist in an IT company.

Iâ€™m currently pursuing a career as a junior frontend developer, while also expanding my skillset by learning React and JavaScript. Iâ€™m working on a project that utilizes these technologies to further strengthen my proficiency.
